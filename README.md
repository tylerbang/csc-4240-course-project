# NFL Attendance

This project conducts an in-depth analysis of the key factors influencing NFL 
attendance over the past twenty years. Our objective was to identify and evaluate
various elements that have historically impacted audience turnout at NFL games.
Through our research, we not only gained insights into the past and present trends
in NFL attendance but also developed models to predict attendance figures for past
NFL games given data such as date, time, and teams.

We got the dataset from
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sujaykapadnis/nfl-stadium-attendance-dataset).
